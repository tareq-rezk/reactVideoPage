00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:06,500
Welcome to this module in this course. I'm going to say it right away.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,480
This module is optional.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:15,780
If you already know next generation javascript, so things like arrow functions, let, const and so on,

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,450
You may very well skip this module. This module is for you if you know javascript but haven't worked

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:30,040
with ES6 or any other version of javascript. Then javascript as we use it in this course might sometimes

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,680
look like a new language to you because of all the next generation features React apps typically

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,600
use.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,960
Now I'm not using these next generation features because I want to show off or anything like that.

9
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,250
React apps typically are built with the latest version of javascript and using the next gen features

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:55,240
allows us to write clean and robust React apps. React itself uses a lot of Next Generation Javascript

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,150
features.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,780
Therefore it's important for you to understand all these features and not be confused by this.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,020
Sometimes really strange looking version of Javascript.

14
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:12,310
Javascript is evolving quickly and therefore new features can look different but really allow us as

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,330
a developer to do more powerful things.

16
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,420
This module is for you, I will walk you through the core features we use in this course so that the code

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,700
thereafter hopefully looks a bit less strange to you.

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,460
And again, feel free to skip this module if you already know it,

19
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,460
feel free to always come back to it if you later in the course encounter something that looks strange

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,210
to you.
