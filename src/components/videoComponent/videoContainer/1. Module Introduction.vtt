Welcome to another important module in this course, testing react apps. Now with testing here,

00:08.990 --> 00:12.580
I don't mean us manually clicking around in our application,

00:12.710 --> 00:17.090
we already do that constantly while developing it. With testing here,

00:17.090 --> 00:22.280
I mean writing automated tests and now here is something important which I want to mention right at

00:22.280 --> 00:29.630
the start of this module, testing is a complex topic and is actually a huge enough topic to make up an

00:29.630 --> 00:32.170
entire course just on its own.

00:32.180 --> 00:39.440
This is not a testing in general introduction and it's also not a complete react testing guidelike

00:39.440 --> 00:40.610
module.

00:40.630 --> 00:48.860
Instead I will introduce you into writing unit tests for react applications built with create react

00:48.860 --> 00:55.190
app and that can then be something you build up on or which helps you apply your general javascript

00:55.190 --> 00:59.600
testing knowledge you already have or gathering other resources.

00:59.690 --> 01:06.080
With that out of the way, let's dive into what testing exactly is in the next lecture and then learn

01:06.080 --> 01:10.940
how we can write tests for our react application.
